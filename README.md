# 100-days-of-bass ðŸŽ¸
tracking my progress on the bass guitar.

## Day 001:
I learned the tabs of Queen's another one bites the dust (riff only). I tried to play to a backing track; my sense of rhythm is there, but it's very weak.

## Day 002:
I re-tried AOBTD and I can play much faster ~100BPM, I also learned the tabs for Billie Jean (again, riff only) I was to slow to try a backing track, but I did it using a barre for the 5th fret on the second and third strings.
