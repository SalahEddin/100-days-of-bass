# 100-days-of-bass ðŸŽ¸
tracking my progress on the bass guitar.

## Day 001:
I learned the tabs of Queen's another one bites the dust (riff only). I tried to play to a backing track; my sense of rhythm is there, but it's very weak.

## Day 002:
I re-tried AOBTD and I can play much faster ~100BPM, I also learned the tabs for Billie Jean (again, riff only) I was too slow to try a backing track, but I did it using a barre for the 5th fret on the second and third strings.

## Day 003:
Practiced Billie Jean mostly, still very slow, but with two changes to my techniques; my eyes are on the plucking hand now and second is me conciously trying to mute the other strings by following through with the plucking hand.

## Day 004:
Still keeping at it; BJ and AOBTD. Plus learned the tabs for Nirvana's Come as you are.

## Day 005:
Added Sunshine of your love by CREAM and practiced previous riffs I learned, I tried playing with a beat on 80Hz and I'm too slow still for this.

## Day 006:
Practicing previous riffs, but trying to look at my plucking hand instead of the fretting hand as this helps me withvisualising my timing 

## Day 007:
Previous riffs, plus learning about playing root, octaves, fifths and sevenths to back a song.

## Day 008:
I can play all of the previous riffs with a backing track (not full speed yet), and practiced the octave and the Disco Riff (4 successive octaves). 

## Day 009:
Practicing the octave intervals.

## Day 010:
Read about music theory, and followed some video explanations. No bass was played. 


## Day 011:
First Jam with Eduardo, practiced Seven Nation Army


## Day 012:
Jammed with Pim and Simon, learned more about rythm and what I can do to improve it.

## Day 013:
Practiced my rythm for songs I knew. 

## Day 014:
Learned to read music sheets, practiced rythm with tapping and counting while plucking on the 2nd quarters etc.
