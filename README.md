# 100-days-of-bass ðŸŽ¸
tracking my progress on the bass guitar.

## Day 001:
I learned the tabs of Queen's another one bites the dust (riff only). I tried to play to a backing track; my sense of rhythm is there, but it's very weak.

## Day 002:
I re-tried AOBTD and I can play much faster ~100BPM, I also learned the tabs for Billie Jean (again, riff only) I was too slow to try a backing track, but I did it using a barre for the 5th fret on the second and third strings.

## Day 003:
Practiced Billie Jean mostly, still very slow, but with two changes to my techniques; my eyes are on the plucking hand now and second is me conciously trying to mute the other strings by following through with the plucking hand.

## Day 004:
Still keeping at it; BJ and AOBTD. Plus learned the tabs for Nirvana's Come as you are.

## Day 005:
Added Sunshine of your love by CREAM and practiced previous riffs I learned, I tried playing with a beat on 80Hz and I'm too slow still for this.

## Day 006:
Practicing previous riffs, but trying to look at my plucking hand instead of the fretting hand as this helps me withvisualising my timing
